# A proposal for GFA 2.0

Jason Chin, Richard Durbin, and myself (Gene Myers) found ourselves together at a workshop
meeting in Dagstuhl Germany and hammered out an initial proposal for an assembly format.
We thought GFA was a good start and built our design around it.  We now offer it up for
comment, criticism, and refinement with the hope that a penultimate version of it might
be accepted by the GFA community and gain further significant adoption.

The white paper is [here](GFA2-spec.md)
=======
The format was first suggested in a [blog post](http://lh3.github.io/2014/07/19/a-proposal-of-the-grapical-fragment-assembly-format/) by Heng Li (@lh3) and further developed in a [second post](http://lh3.github.io/2014/07/23/first-update-on-gfa/).
