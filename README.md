# A proposal for GFA 2.0

Jason Chin, Richard Durbin, and myself (Gene Myers) found ourselves together at a workshop
meeting in Dagstuhl Germany and hammered out an initial proposal for an assembly format.
We though GFA was a good start and built our design around it.  We now offer it up for
comment, criticism, and refinement with the hope that a penultimate version of it gain
significant adoption.

The white paper is [here](GFA2-spec.md)
