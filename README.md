# GFA-spec

This is the github repository for developing the formal specification of the Graphical Fragment Assembly (GFA) format.

The format was first suggested in a [blog post](http://lh3.github.io/2014/07/19/a-proposal-of-the-grapical-fragment-assembly-format/) by Heng Li and further developed in a [second post](http://lh3.github.io/2014/07/23/first-update-on-gfa/).

If you want to contribute, please open up issues on the github page or submit pull requests.
