# The GFA Format Specification

The GFA format is a tab-delimited text format for describing a set of sequences and their overlap. The primary purpose is to represent the result of an assembly as a sequence graph, rather than a linear sequence. The first field of the line identifies the type of the line. Header lines start with `H`. Segment lines start with `S`. Link lines start with `L`. A containment line starts with `C`.
